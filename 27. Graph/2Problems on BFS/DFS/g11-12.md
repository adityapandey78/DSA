## BFS Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph

### Explanation

The Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach detects a cycle by keeping track of visited nodes. The core idea is that if we are traversing the graph and encounter a node that has already been visited and is not the immediate parent of the current node, we have found a cycle.

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   **Adjacency List:** The input edge list is first converted into an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
    *   **Visited Array (`vis`):** An array to keep track of visited nodes to prevent infinite loops and re-processing.
    *   **Queue:** A queue stores pairs of `{node, parent}`. Storing the parent is crucial. It helps us differentiate between a valid back edge (part of a cycle) and simply moving back to the node we just came from.

2.  **Algorithm:**
    *   Iterate through all vertices of the graph to handle disconnected components.
    *   If a vertex hasn't been visited, start a BFS traversal from it.
    *   Push the starting node and a placeholder parent (e.g., -1) into the queue.
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue the current `{node, parent}`.
        *   For each adjacent node (`adjNode`):
            *   If `adjNode` has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it as `{adjNode, node}`.
            *   If `adjNode` has already been visited and it is **not** the `parent` of the current `node`, it means we have found an alternative path to an already visited node, thus forming a cycle. Return `true`.
    *   If the BFS completes for all components without finding a cycle, return `false`.

```cpp
class Solution {
    // Helper function to detect a cycle using BFS starting from a given source node
    bool detect(int src, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& vis) {
        // Mark the source node as visited
        vis[src] = 1;
        // Queue for BFS, storing {node, parent}
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({src, -1}); // Start with source node, no parent (-1)

        while(!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front().first;
            int parent = q.front().second;
            q.pop();

            // Iterate through all adjacent nodes
            for(auto adjNode : adj[node]) {
                // If the adjacent node is not visited
                if(!vis[adjNode]) {
                    vis[adjNode] = 1; // Mark as visited
                    q.push({adjNode, node}); // Push to queue with current node as parent
                } 
                // If the adjacent node is visited and is not the immediate parent
                else if(adjNode != parent) {
                    // A cycle is detected
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        // No cycle found in this component
        return false;
    }

public:
    // Main function to check for cycles in the graph
    bool isCycle(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Step 1: Convert edge list to adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for(auto edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u); // Undirected graph
        }

        // Step 2: Run BFS cycle detection for all components
        vector<int> vis(V, 0); // Visited array, initialized to 0 (not visited)
        // Loop through all vertices to handle disconnected graphs
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if(!vis[i]) {
                // If a cycle is found in any component, return true
                if(detect(i, adj, vis)) return true;
            }
        }
        // No cycles found in any component of the graph
        return false;
    }
};
```
## DFS Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph

### Explanation

The Depth-First Search (DFS) approach detects a cycle by performing a recursive traversal. Similar to BFS, it checks for visited nodes, but the mechanism is slightly different. If DFS encounters an already visited node that is not the immediate parent of the current node in the recursion stack, a "back edge" is found, indicating a cycle.

1.  **Data Structures:**
    *   **Adjacency List:** To represent the graph.
    *   **Visited Array (`vis`):** To keep track of visited nodes.

2.  **Algorithm:**
    *   Iterate through all vertices to handle disconnected components.
    *   If a vertex is unvisited, start a recursive DFS from it.
    *   The `dfs` function takes the current `node` and its `parent` as arguments.
    *   Mark the current `node` as visited.
    *   For each adjacent node (`adjacentNode`):
        *   If `adjacentNode` is not visited, make a recursive call: `dfs(adjacentNode, node, ...)`. If this call returns `true` (meaning a cycle was found deeper in the recursion), propagate `true` up the call stack.
        *   If `adjacentNode` is already visited and is **not** the `parent`, it means we have found a back edge to a node that is an ancestor in the DFS tree (but not the immediate parent). This confirms a cycle. Return `true`.
    *   If the DFS traversal from a node completes without finding a cycle, return `false`.
    *   If all components are traversed and no cycle is found, the graph is acyclic.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to detect a cycle using DFS
    bool dfs(int node, int parent, vector<int>& vis, vector<int> adj[]) {
        // Mark the current node as visited
        vis[node] = 1;
        // Explore all adjacent nodes
        for (auto adjacentNode : adj[node]) {
            // If the adjacent node has not been visited
            if (!vis[adjacentNode]) {
                // Recursively call DFS for the adjacent node
                // If the recursive call finds a cycle, propagate the result
                if (dfs(adjacentNode, node, vis, adj))
                    return true;
            } 
            // If the adjacent node is visited and is not the parent
            // This indicates a back edge and thus a cycle
            else if (adjacentNode != parent) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        // No cycle found starting from this node in this path
        return false;
    }

    // Main function to check for cycles in the graph
    bool isCycle(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Convert edge list to adjacency list
        vector<int> adj[V];
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u); // because undirected graph
        }

        vector<int> vis(V, 0); // Visited array
        // Iterate through all vertices to handle disconnected components
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) {
                // If DFS finds a cycle in any component, return true
                if (dfs(i, -1, vis, adj))
                    return true;
            }
        }
        // No cycle found in the entire graph
        return false;
    }
};
