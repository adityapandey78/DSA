## Detect Cycle in an directed Graph using DFS

### Algorithm Overview
This algorithm detects cycles in a directed graph using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with path tracking. The key insight is that a cycle exists if we encounter a node that's already in our current DFS path.

### Key Concepts
- **vis[]**: Tracks all visited nodes globally
- **pathVis[]**: Tracks nodes in the current DFS path (recursion stack)
- **Backtracking**: Essential for correctly managing the path state

### How It Works
1. **Two-State Tracking**: We maintain two boolean arrays:
   - `vis[node] = 1`: Node has been visited at some point
   - `pathVis[node] = 1`: Node is currently in our DFS path

2. **Cycle Detection Logic**:
   - If we reach an unvisited node → continue DFS
   - If we reach a visited node that's **also in current path** → **CYCLE FOUND**
   - If we reach a visited node **not in current path** → safe (no cycle via this path)

3. **Backtracking**: When we finish exploring a node, we remove it from the current path (`pathVis[node] = 0`)

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    bool dfsCheck(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& vis, vector<int>& pathVis) {
        vis[node] = 1;        // Mark as globally visited
        pathVis[node] = 1;    // Mark as part of current path
        
        // Explore all adjacent nodes
        for (auto it : adj[node]) {
            if (!vis[it]) {
                // Unvisited node - continue DFS
                if (dfsCheck(it, adj, vis, pathVis)) return true;
            } else if (pathVis[it]) {
                // Visited node that's in current path = CYCLE!
                return true;
            }
            // If vis[it] = 1 but pathVis[it] = 0, it's safe (already processed)
        }
        
        pathVis[node] = 0; // Backtrack - remove from current path
        return false;
    }

public:
    bool isCyclic(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Convert edge list to adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        }
        
        vector<int> vis(V, 0);     // Global visited array
        vector<int> pathVis(V, 0); // Current path tracking
        
        // Check each component (graph might be disconnected)
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) {
                if (dfsCheck(i, adj, vis, pathVis)) return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false; // No cycle found
    }
};
```

### Example Walkthrough
Consider graph: `0 → 1 → 2 → 0` (cycle)

1. Start DFS from node 0:
   - `vis[0] = 1, pathVis[0] = 1`
   - Move to node 1: `vis[1] = 1, pathVis[1] = 1`
   - Move to node 2: `vis[2] = 1, pathVis[2] = 1`
   - Try to visit node 0: `vis[0] = 1` ✓ and `pathVis[0] = 1` ✓
   - **Cycle detected!** Node 0 is already in current path

### Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E) - visit each vertex and edge once
- **Space**: O(V) - for vis, pathVis arrays and recursion stack

### Common Gotchas
- **Why two arrays?** `vis` prevents infinite loops, `pathVis` detects cycles
- **Backtracking is crucial**: Without `pathVis[node] = 0`, false positives occur
- **Directed vs Undirected**: This algorithm is specifically for directed graphs
