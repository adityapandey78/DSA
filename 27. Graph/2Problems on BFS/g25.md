## Find eventual safe nodes in a directed graph
This problem involves finding all nodes in a directed graph that are "eventually safe." A node
is considered safe if every path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges). This can be solved using a modified BFS approach.
## Key Concepts
- **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the directed graph.
- **In-degree**: The number of incoming edges to a node.
- **Queue**: Used to process nodes with zero in-degree.
## How It Works
1. **Reverse Graph**: Create a reverse graph where all edges are reversed. This helps in identifying safe nodes.
2. **Build In-degree Array**: Count incoming edges for each node in the reverse graph
3. **Initialize Queue**: Push all nodes with zero in-degree into the queue.
4. **Process Queue**:
   - While the queue is not empty, pop a node, add it to the list of safe nodes, and decrease the in-degree of its neighbors.
   - If any neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, push it into the queue.
5. **Return Result**: Sort the list of safe nodes and return it.

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm uses a modified topological sort approach on a reversed graph to identify safe nodes.

### Graph Reversal Process

```cpp
// This code block reverses the graph
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (auto it : graph[i]) {
        adjRev[it].push_back(i);  // Reverse edge: it -> i becomes i -> it
        indegree[i]++;            // Count incoming edges in original graph
    }
}
```

**How the reversal works:**
- Original edge: `i → it` (node i points to node it)
- Reversed edge: `it → i` (stored in adjRev[it])
- `indegree[i]++` counts how many nodes point TO node i in the original graph

**Example:**
```
Original Graph:
0 → 1 → 2
    ↓   ↑
    3 → 4

Reversed Graph (adjRev):
0 ← 1 ← 2
    ↑   ↓
    3 ← 4

In-degrees in original: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

### Why Reverse?
- Safe nodes are terminal nodes or nodes that only lead to terminal nodes
- In the reversed graph, terminal nodes have zero in-degree
- Using topological sort from zero in-degree nodes identifies all safe nodes
- Nodes in cycles will never reach zero in-degree, so they're excluded

The algorithm processes nodes with zero in-degree first, then removes them and updates neighbors, continuing until all safe nodes are found.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();

        vector<vector<int>> adjRev(n);
        vector<int> indegree(n, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (auto it : graph[i]) {
                adjRev[it].push_back(i);
                indegree[i]++;
            }
        }

        queue<int> q;
        vector<int> safeNode;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            safeNode.push_back(node);

            for (auto it : adjRev[node]) {
                indegree[it]--;
                if (indegree[it] == 0) q.push(it);
            }
        }

        sort(safeNode.begin(), safeNode.end());
        return safeNode;
    }
};

```
