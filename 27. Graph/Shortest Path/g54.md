## Kosaraju Algorithm

### Overview
Kosaraju's algorithm is used to find the number of strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph. A strongly connected component is a maximal set of vertices such that there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex in the component.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **First DFS**: Perform DFS on the original graph and store vertices in a stack based on their finishing times
2. **Graph Reversal**: Create a transpose of the graph by reversing all edges
3. **Second DFS**: Pop vertices from the stack and perform DFS on the transposed graph. Each DFS call gives one SCC

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
- **Space**: O(V) for the stack and visited arrays

### Implementation
```cpp
//Position this line where user code will be pasted.
class Solution {
private:
    void dfs(int node, vector<int>& vis, vector<vector<int>>& adj, stack<int>& st) {
        vis[node] = 1;
        for (auto it : adj[node]) {
            if (!vis[it]) {
                dfs(it, vis, adj, st);
            }
        }
        st.push(node);
    }

    void dfs3(int node, vector<int>& vis, vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
        vis[node] = 1;
        for (auto it : adj[node]) {
            if (!vis[it]) {
                dfs3(it, vis, adj);
            }
        }
    }

public:
    int kosaraju(vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
        int n = adj.size();
        vector<int> vis(n, 0);
        stack<int> st;

        // First DFS to fill the stack
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) {
                dfs(i, vis, adj, st);
            }
        }

        // Reverse the graph
        vector<vector<int>> adjT(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (auto it : adj[i]) {
                adjT[it].push_back(i);
            }
        }

        // Reset the visited array for the second DFS
        fill(vis.begin(), vis.end(), 0);

        // Count strongly connected components
        int scc = 0;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            int node = st.top();
            st.pop();
            if (!vis[node]) {
                scc++;
                dfs3(node, vis, adjT);
            }
        }

        return scc;
    }
};
```

### Key Points
- The first DFS determines the order in which nodes should be processed
- Reversing the graph ensures that we only traverse within SCCs during the second DFS
- Each connected component found in the second DFS represents one SCC
