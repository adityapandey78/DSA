## Shortest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

### Algorithm Overview
This algorithm finds the shortest path from a source vertex (vertex 0) to all other vertices in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. It uses **topological sorting** combined with **dynamic programming** to achieve this efficiently in O(V + E) time.

### Key Concepts
- **DAG**: A directed graph with no cycles, which allows for topological ordering
- **Topological Sort**: Linear ordering of vertices where for every directed edge (u,v), vertex u comes before v
- **Relaxation**: Process of updating shortest distances when a better path is found

### Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
  private:
    // Performs DFS-based topological sort
    void topoSort(int node, vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj, vector<int>& vis, stack<int>& st) {
        vis[node] = 1;  // Mark current node as visited
        
        // Visit all unvisited neighbors
        for (auto it : adj[node]) {
            int v = it.first;  // Adjacent vertex
            if (!vis[v]) {
                topoSort(v, adj, vis, st);  // Recursive DFS call
            }
        }
        // Push to stack AFTER visiting all neighbors (post-order)
        st.push(node);
    }

  public:
    vector<int> shortestPath(int V, int E, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Step 1: Build adjacency list representation
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(V);
        for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
            int u = edges[i][0];   // Source vertex
            int v = edges[i][1];   // Destination vertex  
            int wt = edges[i][2];  // Edge weight
            adj[u].push_back({v, wt});  // Add weighted edge u -> v
        }

        // Step 2: Perform topological sort using DFS
        vector<int> vis(V, 0);
        stack<int> st;
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) {
                topoSort(i, adj, vis, st);  // Sort each component
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Initialize distances (source = 0, others = infinity)
        vector<int> dist(V, 1e9);  // 1e9 represents infinity
        dist[0] = 0;  // Distance to source vertex (0) is 0

        // Step 4: Process vertices in topological order
        while (!st.empty()) {
            int node = st.top();
            st.pop();

            // Only relax edges from reachable vertices
            if (dist[node] != 1e9) {
                for (auto it : adj[node]) {
                    int v = it.first;   // Adjacent vertex
                    int wt = it.second; // Edge weight
                    
                    // Relaxation: update if shorter path found
                    if (dist[node] + wt < dist[v]) {
                        dist[v] = dist[node] + wt;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 5: Mark unreachable vertices as -1
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (dist[i] == 1e9) dist[i] = -1;
        }

        return dist;
    }
};
```

### Why This Algorithm Works

1. **Topological Sort Ensures Optimal Substructure**: By processing vertices in topological order, we guarantee that when we process a vertex, all vertices that can reach it have already been processed with their optimal distances.

2. **No Negative Cycles**: Since it's a DAG, there are no cycles, so we don't need to worry about negative cycles affecting the solution.

3. **Single Pass Sufficiency**: Unlike Bellman-Ford which needs V-1 iterations, topological ordering allows us to find shortest paths in a single pass.

### Time & Space Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E) - Linear time due to single DFS traversal and edge relaxation
- **Space**: O(V) - For adjacency list, visited array, stack, and distance array

### Gotchas & Important Notes

⚠️ **Key Gotcha**: The algorithm assumes vertex 0 is the source. If your source is different, initialize `dist[source] = 0` instead.

⚠️ **Unreachable Vertices**: Vertices with distance `1e9` after processing are marked as `-1` to indicate they're unreachable from the source.

⚠️ **DFS vs BFS for Topological Sort**: This uses DFS with a stack. The stack ensures vertices are processed in correct topological order (reverse of finish times).

### Example Walkthrough
For a graph: 0→1(2), 0→2(1), 1→3(3), 2→3(6)
1. Topological order: [0, 2, 1, 3]
2. Process 0: dist = [0, ∞, ∞, ∞] → [0, 2, 1, ∞]
3. Process 2: dist = [0, 2, 1, ∞] → [0, 2, 1, 7]  
4. Process 1: dist = [0, 2, 1, 7] → [0, 2, 1, 5]
5. Process 3: No outgoing edges
6. Final: [0,
