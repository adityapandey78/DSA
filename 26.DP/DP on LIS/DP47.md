### Explanation of the Code

This C++ code calculates the number of Longest Increasing Subsequences (LIS) in an array. It's a dynamic programming problem that builds upon the classic algorithm for finding the length of the LIS.

#### High-Level Idea

Instead of just tracking the length of the LIS ending at each position, we also need to track the count of how many subsequences achieve that length. To do this, we use two DP arrays:

-   `dp[i]`: Stores the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence that ends with the element `arr[i]`.
-   `cnt[i]`: Stores the count of Longest Increasing Subsequences that end with the element `arr[i]`.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1.  **Initialization**:
    -   `vector<int> dp(n, 1), cnt(n, 1);`: We initialize `dp` with all 1s because any single element is an increasing subsequence of length 1. We initialize `cnt` with all 1s because, for each element, there is exactly one way to form a subsequence of length 1 (the element itself).
    -   `int maxi = 1;`: This variable will keep track of the maximum LIS length found anywhere in the array.

2.  **Nested Loops**:
    -   The code iterates through each element `arr[i]` from left to right.
    -   For each `arr[i]`, it looks back at all previous elements `arr[prev]` (where `prev < i`).

3.  **Core Logic (Inside the loops)**:
    -   The condition `arr[prev] < arr[i]` checks if we can extend a subsequence ending at `prev` with the current element `i`.

    -   **Case 1: Finding a Longer Subsequence**
        -   `if (dp[i] < 1 + dp[prev])`: This means that by appending `arr[i]` to the LIS ending at `arr[prev]`, we've found a new, longer LIS for `arr[i]`.
        -   `dp[i] = 1 + dp[prev]`: We update the length for `dp[i]`.
        -   `cnt[i] = cnt[prev]`: Since this is a new, longer path, we discard any previous counts for `arr[i]`. The number of ways to form this new LIS is simply the number of ways to form the LIS ending at `arr[prev]`. We "inherit" the count.

    -   **Case 2: Finding Another Path of the Same Length**
        -   `else if (1 + dp[prev] == dp[i])`: This means we've found another way to achieve the same LIS length for `arr[i]`. For example, if `arr = {1, 3, 5, 4, 7}` and we are at `i=4` (value 7), we can get a length-4 LIS from both `{1,3,5}` and `{1,3,4}`.
        -   `cnt[i] += cnt[prev]`: We don't change `dp[i]` (the length is the same), but we add the count from the previous path. This accumulates all the different ways to achieve the LIS of that specific length ending at `arr[i]`.

4.  **Finding the Final Result**:
    -   `maxi = max(maxi, dp[i]);`: After the inner loop finishes for `i`, we update `maxi` with the longest LIS length found so far.
    -   The final loop iterates through the `dp` array.
    -   `if (dp[i] == maxi) nos += cnt[i];`: It finds all entries where the LIS length is equal to the overall maximum length (`maxi`) and sums up their counts (`cnt[i]`). This gives the total number of longest increasing subsequences in the entire array.

5.  **Return Value**:
    -   `return nos;`: The function returns the final sum, which is the total count of all LIS.
