## Memoization Approach for Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
```cpp
#include<algorithm>
class Solution {
public:
    int f(int i, int j, vector<int>&cuts,vector<vector<int>>&dp){
        if(i>j) return 0;
        if(dp[i][j]!=-1)return dp[i][j];
        int mini= 1e9;
        for(int ind=i;ind<=j;ind++){
            int cost= cuts[j+1]-cuts[i-1] +f(i,ind-1,cuts,dp)+f(ind+1,j,cuts,dp);
            mini=min(mini,cost);
        }
        return dp[i][j]= mini;
    }
    int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cuts) {
        int c=cuts.size();
        cuts.push_back(n);
        cuts.insert(cuts.begin(),0);
        sort(cuts.begin(),cuts.end());
        vector<vector<int>>dp(c+1,vector<int>(c+1,-1));
        return f(1,c,cuts,dp);

    }
};
```

- cuts[j+1]-cuts[i-1]= This expression calculates the cost of making a cut between the two indices `i` and `j`. It represents the length of the segment that is being cut, which is the difference between the positions of the cuts at `j+1` and `i-1`.  

- f(i,ind-1,cuts,dp) and f(ind+1,j,cuts,dp)= These recursive calls calculate the minimum cost of cutting the segments to the left and right of the current cut at `ind`. The function `f` is called recursively to find the optimal cuts in these segments.

## Tabular Solution for Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
```cpp
int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cuts) {
        int c=cuts.size();
        cuts.push_back(n);
        cuts.insert(cuts.begin(),0);
        sort(cuts.begin(),cuts.end());
        // vector<vector<int>>dp(c+1,vector<int>(c+1,-1));
        // return f(1,c,cuts,dp);

        //Tabular Solution
        vector<vector<int>>dp(c+2,vector<int>(c+2,0)); //wehad to keep c+2 to prevent  +dp[ind+1][j]; out of bound since, ind->i and i->n
        for(int i=c;i>=1;i--){
            for(int j=1;j<=c;j++){
                if(i>j)continue;
                int mini=1e9;
                for(int ind=i;ind<=j;ind++){
                int cost= cuts[j+1]-cuts[i-1] 
                            +dp[i][ind-1]
                            +dp[ind+1][j];
                mini=min(mini,cost);
                }
                dp[i][j]= mini;
            }
        }
        return dp[1][c];
    }
```
- We have kept dp arr as C+2 because we have added two elements to the cuts array (0 and c). This ensures that we can access cuts[j+1] and cuts[i-1] without going out of bounds.

- The outer loop iterates from `c` down to `1`, and the inner loop iterates from `1` to `c`. This ensures that we are filling the DP table in a way that all necessary subproblems are solved before they are needed.
